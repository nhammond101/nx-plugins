# What is Nx

ðŸ”Ž **Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

# What is @nhammond101/nx-plugins

ðŸ”Ž **Extensible Continuous Delivery/Deployment Tools on top of Nx workspace for seamless deployments with frameworks like Serverless Framework and aws-cdk (Infrastructure as a code)**

## Our Mission

Nx is great and simplifying the tool-chains for _continous integrations_ inside a mono-repository. As a developer who has to do operations as well, we would like to see the delivery/deployment side of things to be super awsome as well!

**So we decided to build plugins on top of the nx workspace to add the ability of seamless delivery/deployment of our projects to the designated cloud providers. :metal:**

As time goes by, we have been adding serveral open-source utilities and plugins into this repository both nx related and non-nx related. We add those that benefited us as a developer in the hope of benefiting someone out there as well!

**Please leave us a note if you think it does benefit you and open a Feature request if you think it can be more of a benefit if having those features!**
